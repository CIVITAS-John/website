Since 2019, I have been the founder and project lead of Turtle Universe (TU), the mobile incarnation of [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). My responsibilities include:
- Led a technical and research team with 16 undergraduate and graduate students to design and research the mobile-first incarnation of NetLogo.
- Conducted design-based mixed methods research to understand the design of interactive scaffolds for informal, online learners (AERA 2022, IDC 2023, Constructionism 2023, ISLS 2023).

Originally called [NetLogo Mobile](/talks/2020-netlogo-mobile), Turtle Universe is a full-fledged agent-based modeling and programming app for children, educators, and enthusiasts. It is the foundation of [Tortuga](/portfolio/tortuga) (an editor for interactive tutorials), [NetLogo AR](/portfolio/netlogo-ar), and [NetLogo Chat](/portfolio/netlogo-chat). In May 2024, it has been used by 104,539 people around the world. Please try it out [here](https://turtlesim.com/products/turtle-universe/).

## Related Presentations
Turtle Universe has been my main research site during the Ph. D. studies. While I was designing and developing it, I gave two presentations in ISLS introducing the software: ISLS [2020](/talks/2020-netlogo-mobile), [2021](/talks/2021-netlogo-mobile). Throughout the years, TU has branched out into several sub-projects, each with its own publication record. Please refer to the next section for more information.
