title: "NetLogo Chat (2023-Present)"
excerpt: "NetLogo Chat is an innovative LLM-powered interface designed to enhance learning and practice in NetLogo, a leading language for agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM simulates complex systems using simple rules applied to agents, with applications in fields like disease spread and ecology. Unlike general-purpose LLM tools, NetLogo Chat addresses ABM’s unique challenges by aligning conceptual designs, code, and real-world phenomena. Built on constructionist learning principles, it empowers users to create meaningful models while integrating authoritative sources, supporting troubleshooting, and fostering human-AI collaboration within the NetLogo IDE. <br/><br/><img src='/images/netlogo-chat/asking-questions-back.png' width='600'>"

In early 2023, I designed and studied NetLogo Chat, an innovative LLM-powered interface designed to enhance learning and practice in NetLogo, a leading language for agent-based modeling (ABM). My responsibilities include:
- Led a technical and research team with 5 undergraduate and graduate students to design the first human-AI interface for agent-based modeling. 
– Organized a demonstration-based interview study. From a pool of more than 200 volunteers from all over the world, we interviewed 30 participants from academia and industry. 
– Conducted qualitative analysis to reveal the perception, behavioral, and knowledge gaps between ABM learners with more techncial expertise ("experts") vs. less ("novices") (CHI 2024).
