John (Yuehan) Chen is currently a Ph. D candidate in Computer Science and Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. I am currently working with Prof. Uri Wilensky on my dissertation, titled: Constructionist Learning Design for Agent-based Modeling and Programming: Increasing Access, Building Scaffolds, and Cultivating Communities. 

As a human-computer interaction and learning researcher, I study how to leverage **AI-driven technologies**, such as Generative AI (GAI) or Augmented Reality, to **promote equal access to informal learning at scale**. I lead the research, design, and development of [Physics Lab AR](/portfolio/physics-lab-ar) and [Turtle Universe](/portfolio/turtle-universe), App Store-featured software, reaching 7 million online, out-of-school learners worldwide. 

My real-world projects have produced large-scale human interaction datasets that challenge existing research methodologies. To augment researchersâ€™ capabilities in understanding them, I develop and evaluate novel computational approaches with **GAI for inductive qualitative coding**, with a focus on bias detection (currently in review). 

Throughout my career, I constantly learn from and work with learners of diverse ages and backgrounds. With my extensive experiences in research (incl. leadership), teaching, mentoring, and grant writing, I am looking forward for the next stage of independent research career.
