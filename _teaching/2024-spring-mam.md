In the spring quarter of 2024, I served as a teaching assistant of COMP_SCI 372/472 again. Below is a short description of it (see more in our [course website](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/courses/mam2022/)):

> This course will cover various topics related to the discipline of computer simulation through multi-agent modeling (also called agent-based modeling). Multi-agent modeling specifically focuses on the study of systems where a large number of independent entities (agents) simultaneously interact with each other, resulting in emergent patterns of behavior for the system as a whole.

I participated in the course and syllabus design; provided customized feedback for students each week; worked with 14 advanced undergraduate and graduate students on individual final projects; and taught dozens of sections throughout the quarter.
