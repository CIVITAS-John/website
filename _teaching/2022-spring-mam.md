In the spring quarter of 2022, I served as a teaching assistant of COMP_SCI 372/472. Below is a short description of it (see more in our [course website](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/courses/mam2022/)):

> This course will cover various topics related to the discipline of computer simulation through multi-agent modeling (also called agent-based modeling). Multi-agent modeling specifically focuses on the study of systems where a large number of independent entities (agents) simultaneously interact with each other, resulting in emergent patterns of behavior for the system as a whole.

I participated in the course and syllabus design; provided customized feedback for students each week; worked with 8 advanced undergraduate and graduate students on individual final projects; and taught several sections of the class. In particular, one of my undergraduate student has recently submitted an improved version of the final project paper to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02480) as well as JASSS (Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation).
