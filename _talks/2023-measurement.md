> Chen, J., & Wilensky, U. J. (2023b). Measuring Young Learners’ Open-ended Agent-based Programming Practices with Learning Analytics. Presented at AERA Annual Meeting 2023.

Agent-based modeling (ABM) has been recognized as an important component of computational thinking and literacy. Agent-based programming (ABP) is the computational foundation of ABM. In this study, we propose a novel method to programmatically measure young learners’ ABP practices in open-ended programming contexts with a 4-stage model. We present results from the online community of Turtle Universe, a new version of NetLogo designed for mobile platforms and younger learners in informal contexts. We draw on a dataset of 2,300 block-based and text-based projects shared by out-of-school, unsupervised learners. Our approach generally succeeded in measuring learners’ openended ABP practices. Differences were found among projects of different stages and modalities. We discuss the implications of our approach and design of block-based ABP environments.
