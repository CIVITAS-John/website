## Summary
Building on Papert (1980)'s idea of children talking to computers, we propose ChatLogo, a hybrid natural-programming language interface for agent-based modeling and programming. We build upon previous efforts to scaffold ABM & P learning and recent development in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to support the learning of computational programming. ChatLogo aims to support conversations with computers in a mix of natural and programming languages, provide a more user-friendly interface for novice learners, and keep the technical system from over-reliance on any single LLM. We introduced the main elements of our design: an intelligent command center, and a conversational interface to support creative expression. We discussed the presentation format and future work. Responding to the challenges of supporting open-ended constructionist learning of ABM & P and leveraging LLMs for educational purposes, we contribute to the field by proposing the first constructionist LLM-driven interface to support computational and complex systems thinking.
