NetLogo Mobile is a new mobile-based interface designed to scale and enhance computational thinking in complex systems, empowering diverse stakeholders to create localized models and curricula through innovative design principles. It was subsequently renamed to Turtle Universe and has been used by 50,000 people around the world.

## Summary
We propose a demo session for NetLogo Mobile, the new incarnation of NetLogo for informal and formal learning contexts, and its embedded tools for researchers and educators to design interactive scaffolds. Based on constructionist and situated learning theories, we aim to empower learners to be full participants in agent-based forms of computational media to foster computational thinking. We then walk through the design of the software and describe two sections of the session.
