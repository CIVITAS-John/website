This demo session presents NetLogo Mobile (now: Turtle Universe), innovative tools for educators and researchers to create interactive learning experiences. We grounded the design in constructionist and situated learning theories, with the goal of enhancing computational thinking through active participation in agent-based computational media.

## Summary
We propose a demo session for NetLogo Mobile, the new incarnation of NetLogo for informal and formal learning contexts, and its embedded tools for researchers and educators to design interactive scaffolds. Based on constructionist and situated learning theories, we aim to empower learners to be full participants in agent-based forms of computational media to foster computational thinking. We then walk through the design of the software and describe two sections of the session.
