Velo is an educational tool that integrates robotics and simulation to teach a programming model inspired by Braitenberg vehicles, enabling learners to create complex behaviors by connecting sensors and actuators, and to analyze and program animal-like behaviors.

## Summary
Velo is a learning experience that combines robotics and simulation to help learners understand and apply a simple yet powerful programming model inspired by Braitenberg vehicles. In this model, programs are constructed only by making connections between sensors and actuators. Despite this simplicity, it is possible to achieve complex behaviors similar to that of animals. Velo is designed to be used in a curriculum that aims to help learners not only learn this programming model, but also the process of analyzing an existing (animal) behavior and breaking it down into a form useful for programming.
