NetLogo Mobile is an innovative tools for educators and researchers to create interactive learning experiences. It was subsequently renamed to Turtle Universe and has been used by 50,000 people around the world.

## Summary
A complex systems perspective provides a major opportunity for learning. NetLogo is a powerful tool to foster computational thinking with complex systems. This poster reports on our prototype of NetLogo Mobile, a new interface to NetLogo designed for wide scaling. We introduce its underlying design principles. Through scaling the community, expanding the interactive repertoire, and scaffolding, we empower a variety of stakeholders to create models and curricula for localized needs, embracing learning designs and social behaviors to emerge.
