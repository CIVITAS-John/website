## Summary
A complex systems perspective provides a major opportunity for learning. NetLogo is a powerful tool to foster computational thinking with complex systems. This poster reports on our prototype of NetLogo Mobile, a new interface to NetLogo designed for wide scaling. We introduce its underlying design principles. Through scaling the community, expanding the interactive repertoire, and scaffolding, we empower a variety of stakeholders to create models and curricula for localized needs, embracing learning designs and social behaviors to emerge.
