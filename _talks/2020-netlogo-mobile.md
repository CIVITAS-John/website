Since 2020, NetLogo Mobile has been developed into [Turtle Universe](/portfolio/turtle-universe), a full-fledged agent-based modeling and programming app for children, educators, and enthusiasts. It is the foundation of [Tortuga](/portfolio/tortuga) (an editor for interactive tutorials), [NetLogo AR](/portfolio/netlogo-ar), and [NetLogo Chat](/portfolio/netlogo-chat). In May 2024, it has been used by 105,932 people around the world.

This is the first poster introducing an early prototype of NetLogo Mobile. [Here](/files/talks/2020-mobile.pdf) is its poster. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, I was never able to physically present it. Hope you would enjoy it!

## Aftermath
In 2020, I started sending out prototypes to many online kids through my other project, [Physics Lab](/portfolio/physics-lab). With children's participation, this work was soon developed into another [interactive demo talk](/talks/2021-netlogo-mobile) in ISLS 2021.

## Original Summary
A complex systems perspective provides a major opportunity for learning. NetLogo is a powerful tool to foster computational thinking with complex systems. This poster reports on our prototype of NetLogo Mobile, a new interface to NetLogo designed for wide scaling. We introduce its underlying design principles. Through scaling the community, expanding the interactive repertoire, and scaffolding, we empower a variety of stakeholders to create models and curricula for localized needs, embracing learning designs and social behaviors to emerge.
