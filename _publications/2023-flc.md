## Summary
This paper explores the benefits of interactive scaffolds in constructionist learning experiences with Agent-based Modeling and Programming (ABM & P). While many previous studies have supported ABM & P learning, they often lack embedded interactive scaffolds. In a recent study, we introduced the Tortuga Interactive Scaffolding system for designers to build interactive scaffolds for ABM & P with simple commands that can react to learners’ emergent interactions and a model’s emergent behaviors. To explore the design affordances of this system, we implemented scaffolds for eight agent-based models with three design paradigms: content-agnostic, exploration-oriented, and programming-oriented. With log data collected from out-of-school, online learning contexts, our quantitative analysis shows that exploration-oriented and programming-oriented scaffolds did better to engage learners in constructionist ABM & P activities. We discuss implications for other constructionist learning designers.
