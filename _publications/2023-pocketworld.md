## Summary
Agent-based modeling (ABM) has become a major approach to promote computational thinking and complex systems thinking in K-12 education. However, agent-based programming (ABP), the computational foundation of ABM, is less defined and discussed in previous literature. Summarizing previous studies around ABP from computer science and education, we argued for the potential benefits of introducing ABP to youth. Rooted in the interest development theory, we presented the design of a scaffolded agent-based programming space, the Pocketworld Playground (POP), that aims to engage out-of-school online young learners through developing their interest in ABP. The POP was built in Turtle Universe (TU), the mobile incarnation of NetLogo. Using a mixed-methods approach to analyze log data and artifacts created by learners, we found that POP successfully engaged learners with ABP practices; helped develop situational and individual interest; and contributed to TUâ€™s emerging online community. Finally, we discussed design lessons that could benefit other online learning designers.
