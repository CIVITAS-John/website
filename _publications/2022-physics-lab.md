## Summary
Online youth communities are fertile ground for collaborative learning. While prior research on such communities tends to focus on small-scale or adult-moderated learning spaces, this study reports on Physics Lab’s Online Community (PLOC), a large-scale online youth community that has generated more than 138,000 projects. Using the framework of Community of Inquiry (CoI), our exploratory mixed-methods analysis suggested the existence of CoI’s three interrelated presences: cognitive, social, and teaching in PLOC, and that in absence of instructors, it is possible for youths to perform teaching presence collaboratively.
